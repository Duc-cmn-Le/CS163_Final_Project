Here is this weeks playlist of songs picked by a reader from your suggestions after last weeks callout. Read more about how our weekly Readers recommend series works at the end of the piece.

We start with the familiar: the Pretenders Private Life. Howls of dismay are probably emanating from all points. Grace Joness cover was icily majestic and smoothly controlled, but Chrissie Hyndes original growls with contempt and unbridled scorn. This was a case of dub crossing the Atlantic from Jamaica, being adapted for use in a rock song and then being sold back to the Jamaicans. Result.

Tam Lyn (Retold) is another crosscultural exercise. The Imagined Village featuring Benjamin Zephaniah make all the right noises behind this reinvention of one of Britains oldest folk tales. Eliza Carthy pops in occasionally to add her versatile voice to Zephaniahs ominous, modernist narrative.

Still in the UK, Leicesters Vibronics serve up a molten rhythm that binds the echoing vaults of If a No Jah Dub like dark matter. Most of the bands work is digitally produced, yet they have played acoustic sets at festivals.

Now to Poland, where Hatti Vatti feat Sara Brylewska offer up Different Music. Hatti Vatti is guitarist Piotr Kalinski, a man noted for his collaborations. This songs edgy beats and spectral echoes complement Brylewskas dreamy, almost distracted vocals.

Killing Jokes Turn to Red EP brought them to the attention of such luminaries as John Peel and John Lydon, who set about championing the groups work. The title track originally contained a locked groove that endlessly repeated the word red. Fortunately, this dub version of this song  perfect for todays list  does no such thing. Although clattered and pounded by heavy dub effects, we are released at the end of the song.

Back to the US for Warpaint, with Disco/Very (Trevor Jackson Dub). This songs rigid rhythm is thumped out by drums and bass that allow the vocals to stretch and collapse before re-forming, weaving in and out of some very smart guitar work. Theres a trippy sensibility at work, reminiscent of older musical forms, while the whole thing still manages to sound futuristic.

Brooklyn Funk Essentials Istanbul Twilight is a dubbed-up Anatolian stroll in the company of Turkish clarinetist Hsn enlendirici. This New York-based collective seem at home steering the beats around foreign instruments; equally, the man on the clarinet doesnt appear to leave his comfort zone. Its a heady whiff of Asia Minor, coffee and spices.

Inyaki Yarritus dub experiments earned him credit in Spain and notably in his own Basque region. His impressive track record followed him to London, where he began a studio project known as Basque Dub Foundation. As BDF, his El Secuestro del Dub wears its Augustus Pablo influence on its sleeve, and is all the better for it, as Pablos Middle Eastern licks meld well with Yarritus Iberian temperament.

Next we have Colourboxs Baby I Love You So, which raids Jamaican musics 70s spaghetti western fixation. Somehow, the band made a hit single from such disparate properties as a yearning-for-love vocal, ricocheting pistol shots, sampled movie dialogue and a memorable bassline. It was an adventurous record for the mid-80s, and still jumps off the turntable.

CCTV by LV feat Dandelion creeps stealthily through a squelching soundscape that oozes paranoia. We are in a modern city, where authoritarian eyes track our every move, yet sardonic humour runs through the song. It conjures images of darkened streets where men in Burberry trenchcoats glance warily over their shoulders.

Ursula Ruckers Ring the Alarm takes ill-fated Tenor Saws dancehall classic by the theme and runs with it  towards us. Shouting Feck at us. Brandishing angry slogans as if they were molotov cocktails. This woman has something to say, and she knows how to make you listen. You feel youd better listen. And all the while she circles Saws shimmering lyrics like a predator.

Fat Freddys Drop send us Russia all the way from New Zealand. This is a beautifully sung skankalong heartbeat rhythm that is almost overladen with hooks. These chaps can seriously play. Added to the mix is a plethora of dub effects that spice up an already rich concoction.

And to demonstrate that dub is welcome everywhere music is played, we retire to bucolic Cheltenham to polka to a reggae beat. Just think of an instrument, any instrument, and you will most likely hear it stepping in somewhere to take a turn in Edward II and the Red Hot Polkas Bjorn Again Polka. This is one record Id like to morris dance to.

Not all songs appear on the Spotify playlist as some are unavailable on the service.
