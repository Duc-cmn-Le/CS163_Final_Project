Ukraine Says There's No Evidence of Illicit Payments to Manafort

Ukrainian prosecutors said theyd found no proof of illicit payments to U.S. President Donald Trumps former campaign manager from his work for the party of the nations ousted leader.

Anti-corruption investigators in the ex-Soviet republic said last year that theyd found ledgers showing $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments between 2007 and 2012 earmarked for Paul Manafort from Viktor Yanukovychs Party of Regions. But a probe uncovered no evidence, chief anti-graft prosecutor Nazar Kholodnytskyi told Ukrainian television.

There were no Manafort signatures on any page of this ledger, he said late Monday.

The news follows last weeks visit by Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko to Washington, where he met Trump in the White House. Manafort, whod previously advised the Party of Regions and helped Yanukovych become president, denies any wrongdoing with regard to his activities in Ukraine.
